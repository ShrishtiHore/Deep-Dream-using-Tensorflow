# Deep-Dream-using-Tensorflow
 
Deep Dream is a computer vision program created by Google which uses convolutional neural networks to find and enhance patterns in images thus creating a dream like hallucinogenic apppearance in the deliberately over_processed images.
We are using the link https://storage.googleapis.com//download.tensorflow.org//models//inception5h.zip for the problem.
And the main directory ..//data// .
The main libraries to be imported are matplotlib, numpy, tensorflow, urllib, zipfile and PIL.
